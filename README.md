# GM-make-paradigms
Read cvs files and the like to create data that geometrical morphology can use.
The program assumes the presence of a config.txt file, which has an even number of lines, like this:

latin-nouns-1.txt
latin-nouns-1.tex
latin-nouns-2.txt
latin-nouns-2.tex

The even number line gives the name of the text file with a paradigm and the odd numbered line gives the name of the tex file generated.
